\section{Conclusion}

In summary, this research proposal aims to build an automated Forex trading system that uses Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to generate trading signals. It intends to implement Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), particularly Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, under the DRL model and incorporate sophisticated feature engineering and optimisation techniques, addressing significant gaps in the current literature. The proposed system is intended to integrate with the cTrader platform, enabling real-time data processing, online learning, and easy live deployment, along with an advanced evaluation framework, including visual backtesting and expert performance metrics. This research seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in automated Forex trading, providing a robust and scalable solution for algorithmic trading in complex and dynamic market environments.
